# Medical-image-detection
Use 3 different CNN models to classify 5,856 patient X ray images (earlystopping, modelcheckpoint and reduceronplateau are used to prevent overfitting) and build a model to predict whether the patient has pneumonia. YOLO and google co-lab was used to classify 6000 ophthalmic medical images and the eye, pupil, front slit and back slit in the images were labeled.
